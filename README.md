# Co-Teach Informatica website

In the spirit of Co-Teach, we are making our website's source code openly
available.

⚠ **The website is currently in its soft launch period** ⚠ This means that while
the website is publicly accessible, it is not yet promoted through national
channels. We very much welcome your feedback as one of our first visitors.

## Contributing

The website is statically generated using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and
TypeScript. The site was built pragmatically: re-use in other contexts was not a
prime concern.

If you see any typos, unclear phrasing, suboptimal styling or anything else that
could use some work: feel welcome to leave an
[issue](https://github.com/co-teach/website/issues) or make a
[pull request](https://github.com/co-teach/website/pulls).

## Licence

Please take note that while the source code is licensed under the MIT license
(as can be read in `LICENSE.md`), assets and contents are licensed differently
(see `ASSETS_LICENSE.md` for details).
